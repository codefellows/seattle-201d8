# Lab for Class 12 (Week 3, Tuesday)
### New Bus Mall Technical Goal

- Using ChartJS, display your vote totals in a **bar chart**.

- The size and look of your chart is up to you, just be sure to put it in the area beneath the three images.

- Stretch Goal (not required; only if you want an additional challenge): If you want to try some additional chart types, do so with some of your alternate data that you have calculated from your vote results, such as the percentage of click-throughs when an image is shown.

- Stretch Goal (not required; only if you want an additional challenge): Apply some data organization prior to charting. Maybe you chart only the top 5 or top 10 items? Maybe you sort the click-through percentage and then only show the top 5, in order? Use your creativity. Think about how you would like this information to be presented if you were trying to make decisions about products to manufacture and market, come up with a plan for it, and build it!

Submit your assignment on Canvas as usual.
