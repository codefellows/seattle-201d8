# Student Comments from Week 2

### WHICH ASPECTS OF THE TRAINING DID YOU FIND THE MOST HELPFUL DURING THIS WEEK?

- I really enjoyed the class time this week. I learned a lot from Brian's CSS framework demo, and I felt like I have an attack plan when I'm writing HTML and CSS now.

- I really liked the lab when we added event listeners to our form, and then added content to our *[the comment ended here]*

- CSS with Brain

- The labs and the lectures, especially the CSS ones because CSS is the most challenging.

- Good stuff: live code demos and built out examples.

- The labs are still the best part. I wish they were longer!!!! They are so helpful.

- We got some really great, concrete guidelines for design, which really helped.

- This week the labs were particularly insightful as that's when I got to apply the things I've learned from lecture and practice writing/understanding code as well as domain modeling.

- Pair programming is amazing for helping to show you what you do when you code. Working on your own definitely encourages you to withdraw into your own shell and pair programming breaks you out of that.

- Everything was helpful. We learned an absolute ton (lots of JS, lots of CS).

- Brian's CSS tutorials were absolutely fantastic!

- Brian Nations' CodePen demos are excellent.

- Thanks to the instruction team for turning around the time management issue. It's gratifying to have instructors who crave feedback, and who act on it so successfully.

- Lab time has been a good opportunity to learn and grow.

### WHICH ASPECTS OF THE TRAINING DID YOU FIND THE LEAST HELPFUL DURING THIS WEEK?

#####Git

- I still feel a little lost with git when working in a group. I'm doing my best with the team collaboration but it would have been nice to have a seen a live demo in class rather that just a whiteboard demo

- We spent a lot of time trying to explain git to students and it seemed like they were still having a hard time understanding it, so maybe you guys can find/make a good demo of a more complete git process in actual use? I'm not sure what that would look like, but it's really important that they get a good grasp of what git is doing and how we use it. Maybe even do an exercise where we get and handle a merge conflict on purpose so we know what they are and how to deal with them.

#####Reading

- Maybe the reading because there was so much in the beginning, though it was nice at the end to have a reading break.

- The book reading is actually valuable, but so hard to remember that I keep referring to my book. It's a little embarrassing because I'm all "I swear, I actually read this, but I don't remember the details that I need right now..."

#####Pace

- It's all pretty helpful.

- I was really dragging by Wednesday afternoon. The pace this week was grueling.

- Our progress through topics has been so fast that it is hard to really internalize things. That said, it is a month-long course so I wouldn't expect anything less!.

- Just a lot of information to take in.

- Code Fellows 201 is a highly evolved instructional program. In my experience, everything is helpful. But some things are uncomfortable. But if I wanted comfort, I wouldn't have enrolled in boot camp. :-)

- The lectures have at times gone over my head.


### DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, SUGGESTIONS, OR CONCERNS?

- I'm enjoying the paired programming. I really like talking about the code and preparing a strategy with a partner before we start writing it.

- Overall I think things are going pretty well :).

- My only question is less specific to the class directly and more so aimed at the preceding 301 course and applications. I've received an email that the course and scholarship have been added to my application but I can't access/see them on my panel and was wondering when I'll be able to make a move on that process?
