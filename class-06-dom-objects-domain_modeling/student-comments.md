# Student Comments from Week 1

### WHICH ASPECTS OF THE TRAINING DID YOU FIND THE MOST HELPFUL DURING THIS WEEK?

CSS training.

Code review was good, Brian's lectures are generally great.. The most helpful bits are really the rules clarification bits to me. Coding, just like anything having to do with computers, is a game of rules (or mechanics). Once you learn what those rules are you know pretty well what you can and cannot do and where the edges are that will break things. I liked the live code demos a lot too, where they open up Chrome or CodePen and make something right there (or have an example prepped to work with) that shows us exactly what ours should look like and how it goes together.

Learning the basics CSS has been awesome, and I think we are about to go a lot deeper. Also I had never used Git or GitHub before, so this has been an eye opening experience in to version control. I'm also learning a lot about how to use the terminal.

I'm still trying to get used to it, but the 15 minute rule makes it easier to ask for help and not feel embarrass because I can't wrap my brain around something.

The labs

The lab time is great. Getting your hands on the code and working through it has been the best way to learn things.

I found the in depth support from instructors was the most helpful part.

I found the lab time to be particularly helpful. Getting a chance to experience the course content in a more direct context has been helpful in solidifying learning.

The lab work is very important to have that time to sit and absorb what the class has talked about. It's extremely helpful to have all those resources available while also being able to just work on it and jam the data you just learned into a practical situation.

I've found lecture to be particularly helpful during this past week. Lecture introduces new fundamental concepts that are explained and exemplified thoroughly which gives me a general understanding of new topics that I can later utilize and better understand in lab.

1. The mix of learning modalities (reading, lecture, labs, quiz, pair work) helps me learn of different levels, and continually reinforces the knowledge. 2. The respectful, inclusive culture of Code Fellows makes me feel comfortable, so that I learn more easily and enjoy the process.

The code review is super helpful. It is nice to see what code is simplest and most elegant, especially in relation to the code I've written.

The lab time is amazing. I think I am a hands-on learner and these are so great. As with learning any language, practice is the key. So, it's all about trying things out and seeing what works and learning why it works. It's great to have this space to practice and try things without judgement and have so much amazing support from the instructors to help you through it. I really appreciate the "don't spend more than 15 minutes on a problem" motto. It makes me feel more apt to ask questions and know that the instructors are ready to pop in and help me suss it out.

Lectures.

### WHICH ASPECTS OF THE TRAINING DID YOU FIND THE LEAST HELPFUL DURING THIS WEEK?

Html.

We're doing a lot of reading and it's hard to try to absorb that much information at this pace. I guess I don't have a good 'least helpful' thing.. I feel like I got something out of every lecture really.

We started out a little bit slow, but by Friday we really started to pickup. On the first day we had a lot of slides, but maybe it could have been more productive with examples. I really like to see things live in codepen when teachers are explaining a new topic.

It gets *really* hard to concentrate on the lecture when it gets pushed past 12:30.

Hmm I'm tempted to say the reading, but I know that it is a necessary evil and will rely on it more later.

Due to the nature of the course, there is a lot of information to take in. By day 5 of the first week, I found myself a little overwhelmed by everything being thrown at me in the lectures.

I found class going over four hours had diminishing returns in the lecture.

I found doing the readings and posting about them to the discussion board to be less helpful.

All of training has been helpful.

Learning Journal. I like to take notes by hand, making diagrams and doodles. Inputting a daily LJ file feels like a chore. Markdown is great for workflow notes, but has too many formatting constraints for a personal journal.

Some parts of the lecture have been monotonous as it just summarized what we read.

I wouldn't say that there is anything that has been unhelpful this week. There has been a deluge of information, getting used to the environment, and preparing us for this intensive learning experience. But, I do think that the lecture time could be better managed. I truly REALLY like all of the instructors as people AND educators; they each have displayed their talents, personalities and are very approachable,but I think there could be a little less of personal stories and pep talks during the morning lecture time. There is so much to cover, and while I find personal experiences to be valuable, at points it feels tangential and to take up more class time than covering the topics. I would appreciate a more structured lecture time where we just power through the material and the main focus is on getting through the learning goals for that section of class.

The white board instruction is great info but seems go faster then I can take notes AND absorb what is being said. My current time management doesn't allow for watching the videos to get the steps down. That would be my problem.

### DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, SUGGESTIONS, OR CONCERNS?

No

We've really got to break for lunch at a reasonable time. I would not mind coming back into the classroom after lunch for another session if we need more instructional time, that's part of the code school experience right? But I usually don't eat a big breakfast and kind of catch up at lunch with more food, so pushing that back an hour or more leaves me mostly thinking about the food I'm hungry for and not paying very much attention to the materiel. We also tend to dawdle a bit during lecture. I know it's we're always running short on time so I feel like it might be helpful to just have the 2 instructors that aren't currently speaking keep one eye on the clock vs the schedule and gently prod things along once in awhile.

You should really STRONGLY advise students to bring a mac. I didn't know any better and brought my PC the first day. I had to go to the apple store the first night to get a new laptop, and then go through the setup process again that night. It was a good way to review what we did in class, but was kind of painful. Also, the projector really bounces around a lot due the the AC fan where it's mounted. Would it be possible to mount it some where else? It was very distracting the first day, when we had a full day of slides. Also the instructors have a hard time moving the whiteboard around due to the power cables, you may want to plug them in somewhere else.

Time management with 3 instructors seems a bit wonky, but I'm not sure what I could suggest that would help with that. I know they're working on it.

Not at the moment

Keep up the good work!

I think it is better to break for lunch at noon no matter what and then do more lecture at 1 is better than 4 hours of straight lecture.

No, I do not.

If we are going to finish class late (say at 12:45pm), let us grab our lunch at 11:30 so we don't sit around getting progressively hungrier.

Nope! All good for now. Gotta go hit the books now and try to really understand loops!
