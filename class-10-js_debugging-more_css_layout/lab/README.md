# Assignment Overview: Lab for Class 10
### DUE: Sunday  6/26 at 11:59pm

## Create a webpage from a provided design comp

In lab today you will be building some webpages based off of the provided design comp assets. This assignment is a lot of HTML and CSS, and not as much JS as we've been doing this week. In fact, you may choose to do this project with no JS at all, or just add some as a finishing touch.

This will be a group-programming project, and you should take the following approach:

1. One member of the group sets up a repo on GitHub.
2. Once this is done, go into the Settings tab of the repo and set the other members of the group as Collaborators.
3. At this point, everyone can CLONE the repo. No need to fork it in this case. All of the collaborators have privileges to push to the repo and also to do merges.
4. Each person in the group will do the bulk of the work on one of the pages, but there's going to be a lot of overlap with the CSS between the pages, too, so there needs to be some teamwork involved as well. How you manage that is up to you. We'll give some suggestions.

# Design Comp

In [layouts](./layouts) you will find PDFs for three pages of a site. Use your skills in HTML and CSS to build this site, with appropriate links between pages. Read thoroughly through the guidelines below. You may use the internet for help, however **any code that is not yours should be noted in your README.md**. Use this project as an opportunity to display your knowledge and abilities with Git by employing best practices in version control. Commit frequently with meaningful commit messages.

### Guidelines

- **YOU DO NOT NEED TO USE ANY JAVASCRIPT FOR THIS PROJECT.**
- You can replace the cat images with whatever you want, as long as it's tasteful. Use good judgement. Placeholder images are fine. The current images came from [placekitten.com](http://www.placekitten.com)
- You can replace the page text with whatever you want, however keep the subject matter throughout the site self-consistent, and again keep it tasteful *(in other words, Samuel L. Ipsum is not an appropriate choice)*.
- Any links that would lead to external pages (e.g. social media sites) should just remain as either dead links (so, link to "#") or simply to the homepages of those sites (e.g. Facebook icon links to facebook.com). **There should be no other external links.**
- You don't have to use the same exact social media icons used here, but they should be the same brands and be of an appropriate size.
- The Contact form shouldn't actually submit data to anything. If you want to stretch into a little JavaScript, then when the Submit button is hit, log the information in the form to the console.
- Use standard conventions for indenting nested tags and structuring your CSS. Keep it clean.

### Submitting Your Work

- You will create a team GitHub repository for your work and each submit the link to that repository
- You will deploy your site to a `gh-pages` branch.
- In the README of this repository, you'll include the link to the site that you've built. Use your README as an opportunity to document your submission, using markdown for basic formatting.
- In your Canvas submission, describe the parts of the work that you did on this assignment.

**Requirements**

Use good HTML structure to scaffold this site. Reminders: Container elements (a box outside of your content box that might contain multiple content boxes) are very useful in managing layout. You will need to think about the relationship between parent and child / descendant elements as well as the order in which you place them in the HTML. Keep in mind that you can use *display: inline* in your CSS to force block elements, which would ordinarily stack, to sit side-by-side. Be thoughtful about your CSS layout strategy.

Use CSS to style the page to reflect the full comp image provided as closely as possible. Use what knowledge you have at this point (and any resources you are able to understand and use effectively from other sources) to style your site as closely to the design comp as you can: fonts, colors, layout, all of it. You have the resources and are aware of online tools which will help you find useful solutions! On a project like this, something that finishes the basic task is the goal... it can always be refactored with better design and code later. There are no right or wrong answers... just do your best.

OPTIONAL: Add some JavaScript functionality! Get creative, but make sure the style is complete before moving onto any additional features. Wouldn't it be neato if you could actually check those checkboxes?

Submit: You'll be committing regularly and working on branches for additional Git practice. Submit the link to your most recent pull request into the Canvas assignment.
