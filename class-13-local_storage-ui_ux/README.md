# Today's Plan: Week 3, Wednesday Lecture

#### Reminder: Quiz 7 was published last night and will be due at 11:59pm tomorrow night.

#### Quiz 8 will be published tomorrow afternoon, and will be due Friday night at 11:59pm.

On Friday afternoon we'll publish the entrance exam for Code 301, which doubles as the final exam for this course, and it will be due by Monday night by 11:59pm. Do take this exam even if you are not planning to go to Code 301 right away, as it is part of your grade for this course. The exam is a bit different from the quizzes for multiple reasons:

1. It is longer: 25 questions. (Still all multiple-guess, at least)
2. It is administered by a company called EdRepublic and is actually their exam mechanism embedded in Canvas, so it is going to look a little different.
3. You only get one attempt at taking it. No re-dos.

- Announcements
  - Nadia will be out for some portion of today, maybe most/all of the day. She has an interview starting at 10:00a and that will go for some unknown amount of time.
  - Sam, Nick, and Brian have a meeting noon-1:00. They'll need to roll in some breaks after that, plus, Sam has a meeting 1:30-2:00.
  - Project Week is getting closer! Er. Mah. Gerd.
  - TODAY: First round of project pitches! Remember, not everyone is required to pitch a project idea, and also that you still have tomorrow to do a pitch if you are not ready today. Remember: elevator pitches! It's a chance meeting and you have no materials prepared to show off your idea, only the power of your verbal persuasion.
  - TOMORROW (Thursday): Second round of project pitches & set project teams!

## UI & UX discussion

Let's have a discussion on UI/UX, and also look at a few websites (some awesome, some kind of randomly chosen) relating to design and interaction.
- [All Websites Look the Same](http://www.zeldman.com/2015/09/10/all-websites-look-the-same/)
- [5 Ridiculously Common Misconceptions about UX](https://www.sitepoint.com/5-ridiculously-common-misconceptions-about-ux/)

When you start with your own projects, one of the things you will be fully responsible for is UI and UX. Be thoughtful.
