# Today's Plan: Week 3, Friday Lecture... LAST CLASS DAY!

#### We will start today by reviewing Quiz 7(the Dog constructor).

#### Reminder: Quiz 8 (only 5 questions!) is due tonight.

#### The Code 301 entrance exam will be published later today.

- Announcements
  - 1:00 today, we'll go watch the final project presentations for the current Code 301 class.
  - Reminder: weekly surveys will go out to students today.
  - We're in Project Week! Keep in mind that Monday is a holiday, so we will not be here and CF will (probably) not be open, but you and your team are free to set up any work processes that day that you choose to.
  - There is a blackout window on submitting classwork during Project Week. In other words, you should be 100% focused on your project for the next week. The exceptions to that are the final BusMall submission and the 301 exam, each of which is due at 11:59pm Monday 7/4. But for the rest of the week, do not spend energy on catching up on past assignments.
  - You'll have one week after project presentations to turn in any lingering late work. The deadline for that will be Friday 7/15 at 11:59pm.
  - Remember that each team will be expected to do a 5-10 minute standup meeting at the beginning of each day. Those will begin on Tuesday morning. No set time, just when your team is assembled and the instructional staff are free.
