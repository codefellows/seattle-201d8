  - Instructional staff will be spread a little thin today, but we're going to do our very best to be available for you:
    - Sam, Nick, and Brian will be in a meeting during the noon hour and will need some sort of a break after that.
    - Brian will be out of lab roughly 1:00-3:00 due to external obligations.
    - Sam has meetings at 3:30 and 4:00, so he'll be out of pocket later in the afternoon
