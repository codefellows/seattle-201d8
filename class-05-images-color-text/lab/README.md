# Assignment Overview: Lab for Class 5

There are two parts to your lab assignment, and each is in a ***separate assignment in Canvas***:

### First Part: Over the weekend

One of them is a weekend project: put finishing touches on your About Me project and get it deployed. This will be due at 11:59pm on Sunday evening. The more time you spend with this, the better you'll get at CSS, but keep in mind that you also have readings to do and need to get some rest and relaxation in as well!

### Second Part: In lab today & over weekend as needed

Today in lab you will create a new GitHub repo, and write the solutions to some code problems.

**Be sure to follow instructions carefully.**

Here are a couple of things to keep in mind:

* Place no function calls in your code, unless inside of another function or specifically instructed. Everything should be run by hand from the console. This is to give you additional practice using the console and practice efficient app-switching processes.
* **Create a new branch for each code problem**, and merge each branch into *master* when the problem is completed. This is to give you practice with GitHub branches. Do the problems in order. Don't forget to pull the new master branch from GitHub into your local master branch each time, before creating the branch for the next problem.

To get started, create and clone a new GitHub repo named ***class-05-lab***

### HTML and JS setup
You are being given starter code for today, in the index.html and app.js files inside of this directory. Your instructions are in the JS file.

Submission instructions are in the Canvas assignment, as per usual.
