# Assignment Overview: Lab for Class 5

There are two parts to your lab assignment, and each is in a different assignment in Canvas:

### First Part: Over the weekend

One of them is a weekend project: put finishing touches on your About Me project and get it deployed. This will be due at 11:59pm on Sunday evening. The more time you spend with this, the better you'll get at CSS, but keep in mind that you also have readings to do and need to get some rest and relaxation in as well!

### Second Part: In lab today

Today in lab you will create a new GitHub repo, and pair-program the solutions to some little code problems.

**Be sure to follow instructions carefully.**

Here are a couple of things to keep in mind:

* Place no function calls in your code, unless inside of another function. Everything should be run by hand from the console. This is to give you additional practice using the console and practice efficient app-switching processes.
* Create a new branch for each code problem, and merge each branch into *master* when the problem is completed. Do the problems in order. Don't forget to pull the new master branch from GitHub into your local master branch each time, before creating the branch for the next problem.
