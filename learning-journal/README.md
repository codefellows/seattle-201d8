# Today I Learned...

One of the most effective tools in adult learning is reflection. By writing coherent summaries of some lesson learned, we cement that learning and deepen our understanding of a subject.

## Tasks

Each day, write an entry in your learning journal about some lesson you learned that day. Your entry may contain code samples, links to additional resources you found, or anything else you feel is relevant. I have found a correlation between students who write consistently in their journals, and student who succeed in class. Take this assignment seriously.

- Create a repository called `daily-learning-journals`
- Create a markdown file for that day, e.g. "LJ-code201-day1.md"
- h1-level header at the top entitling the document with the day's entry, e.g. "# LJ Code 201 - Day 1"
- Write to your heart's content. Write about what you learned, what may or may not have happened in group work, what you're hoping for, etc. This is for your own reflection more than it is just another thing for us to assess you on.

See "sample-LJ.md" for an idea of how it should look.
