# LJ Code 201 - Day 100

Today we worked on a number of things. They weren't too bad. HTML layouts are definitely manageable for me now; they're just architecture at this point. CSS is a pain in the ass though. All of these conflicting rules, figuring out when `margin: auto;` works or not, it's all so damn confusing. Maybe I need to make some test document and just try out different CSS configurations? Maybe I need to rework my classes and IDs?

We're starting to think seriously about our final projects now. It's not going as well as I'd hoped. I'd had this idea to build a virtual Blackjack game, but no one else latched onto it so it's on the cutting room floor. We're making some sort of blog site instead. I'm not all that excited about it, but I guess you've gotta do what you've gotta do? 

Hey, on the bright side, we're about to be done with this course! Woo!
